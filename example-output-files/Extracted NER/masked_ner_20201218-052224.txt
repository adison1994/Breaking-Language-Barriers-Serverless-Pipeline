<speak>you're listening to Ted talks daily families <say-as interpret-as='expletive'>Hugh</say-as> Some of us humans can get fixated on death or how we're gonna die, but we're not the only species to do so. In her Ted X Salem talk from 2020 wildlife researcher <say-as interpret-as='expletive'>Kelly Swift</say-as> offers what we can learn from crows and how they attend to the dead or or what we might have already learned from them. That shows up in our rituals.

Spend a great deal of time considering death, and it's possible we've been doing so since shortly after Homo SAPIENs first begin roaming the landscape. After all, the first intentional human burial is thought to have occurred around 100,000 years ago. What might those early people have been thinking as they took the time to dig into the earth, deposit the body and carefully cover it up again? Were they trying to protect it from scavengers or stymie the spread of disease? Were they trying toe honor the deceased? Or did they just not wanna have to look at a dead body without the advent of a time machine? We may never know for sure what those early people were thinking, but one thing we do know is that humans are far from alone in our attention towards the dead. Like people, some animals including the Corvettes. The family of birds that houses the crows, Ravens, magpies and jays also seem to pay special attention to their dead. In fact, the rituals of Corvettes may have acted as the inspiration for our own. After all, it was the rave in that <say-as interpret-as='expletive'>God</say-as> sent down to teach cane how to bury his slain brother, <say-as interpret-as='expletive'>Abel</say-as>. But despite this clear recognition by early people that other animals attend to their dead, it's only fairly recently that science has really turned its attention towards this phenomenon. In fact, a formal name for this field comparative fan <say-as interpret-as='expletive'>Atala Gee</say-as> wasn't first introduced until 2016 in this growing field were beginning to appreciate what a rich place, the natural world iss with respect to how other animals interact with their dead. And it's in this growing body of knowledge that that time machine to our early ancestors might be possible. So what are we learning in this growing field? Well, right now, we can split our understanding into two main groups. In the first, we have animals that display stereotyped, predictable behaviors towards their dead, and for whom much of what we understand about them comes from experimental studies. This group includes things like the social insects, bees and ants and termites. And for all of these animals, colony hygiene is of critical importance. And so, as a result, these animals display rigorous undertaking behaviors. In response to corpses, for example, they may physically remove carcasses from the colony. They may consume them. They may even construct tombs. We see similar hygiene driven responses in some colony living mammals. Rats, for example, will reliably <say-as interpret-as='expletive'>Barry Cage</say-as></speak>
